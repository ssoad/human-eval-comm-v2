Then it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is less than the threshold. If it finds any pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, it returns True immediately. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any close elements, it returns False.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n\n```python\nprint(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False\nprint(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True\n```",

For example:\n\n- What is the input to this function? A list of numbers, but what kind of numbers (integers, floats, etc.)?\n- What is the expected output of this function? A boolean value, but what does it represent (is the list valid, is the list sorted, etc.)?\n- Are there any specific requirements or constraints for this function (e.g. time complexity, space complexity)?\n\nHere's a possible completion of the function signature based on a common use case:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef is_sorted(lst: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order.\"\"\"\n```\n\nPlease let me know if this is what you had in mind or if I need to make any adjustments.",
