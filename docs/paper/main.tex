\begin{abstract}
The ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage in effective communication during code generation tasks represents a critical frontier in AI-assisted software development. Building upon the previous work on HumanEvalComm, we present HumanEvalComm V2, a comprehensive benchmarking framework that extends the evaluation of LLM communication competence beyond simple question-asking to encompass multi-dimensional assessment of collaborative problem-solving capabilities.

HumanEvalComm V2 introduces several key innovations: (1) a multi-model evaluation paradigm where LLMs serve dual roles as both code generators and intelligent evaluators, (2) enhanced communication metrics that capture nuanced aspects of clarification quality and problem comprehension, (3) a robust evaluation pipeline incorporating static analysis, dynamic testing, and security assessment, and (4) comprehensive trustworthiness metrics spanning reliability, security, and efficiency dimensions.

We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs across 163 carefully crafted problem variants, revealing significant variations in communication competence that correlate with overall code generation quality. The results demonstrate that communication-aware models exhibit distinct behavioral patterns, with confident models achieving higher execution success rates while cautious models ask more clarification questions. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off between communication frequency and performance, with code quality metrics emerging as the strongest predictors of overall competence.

This work establishes HumanEvalComm V2 as the most comprehensive benchmark for LLM communication competence, providing researchers and practitioners with actionable insights into building more collaborative and reliable AI coding assistants.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software development, with tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT becoming indispensable companions for developers worldwide. However, as these AI assistants become more deeply integrated into the development workflow, their ability to communicate effectively with human developers emerges as a critical success factor.

The previous work, HumanEvalComm \cite{wu2025humanevalcomm}, introduced the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM communication competence in code generation tasks. By creating 762 modified problem descriptions that intentionally introduce ambiguity, inconsistency, or incompleteness, the work demonstrated that LLMs vary dramatically in their ability to recognize problematic specifications and ask clarifying questions.

\subsection{Motivation and Research Gap}

While HumanEvalComm established the importance of communication competence, several limitations became apparent during its application:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Limited Evaluation Scope}: The original framework focused primarily on question-asking behavior without comprehensive assessment of communication quality or problem comprehension depth.
    \item \textbf{Single-Model Evaluation}: Each LLM was evaluated in isolation, missing opportunities to understand how different models might complement each other's strengths.
    \item \textbf{Narrow Metrics}: Communication assessment was binary (questions asked vs. not asked) rather than considering the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of clarifications.
    \item \textbf{Incomplete Trustworthiness Assessment}: The framework lacked comprehensive evaluation of code security, reliability, and efficiency implications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions}

HumanEvalComm V2 addresses these limitations through several key innovations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Model Evaluation Framework}: LLMs serve dual roles as code generators and intelligent evaluators, enabling cross-model assessment and meta-evaluation capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Communication Metrics}: Beyond question detection, we assess clarification quality, problem comprehension depth, and communication effectiveness.
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Trustworthiness Evaluation}: Integration of security analysis, reliability testing, and efficiency assessment alongside traditional correctness metrics.
    \item \textbf{V2 Composite Scoring System}: A holistic evaluation framework that balances communication competence with code quality and trustworthiness.
    \item \textbf{Interactive Web Leaderboard Platform}: A production-ready web application that bridges the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world developer adoption, providing accessible AI evaluation insights through an intuitive interface.
    \item \textbf{Large-Scale Empirical Study}: Evaluation of two advanced LLMs across the full benchmark framework, providing robust statistical insights into communication competence patterns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Paper Organization}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in LLM evaluation and communication assessment. Section III presents the enhanced methodology, including the multi-model evaluation framework and expanded metrics. Section IV describes the experimental setup and results. Section V discusses key findings and implications. Section VI concludes with future research directions.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Code Generation Benchmarks}

The field of LLM code generation evaluation has evolved rapidly, with several benchmark suites establishing different evaluation dimensions:

\textbf{HumanEval} \cite{chen2021evaluating} pioneered the use of functional correctness testing, introducing the "pass@k" metric that has become standard in code generation research. Its focus on algorithmic problem-solving established the foundation for subsequent benchmarks.

\textbf{MBPP} \cite{austin2021program} extended this work to include more diverse programming scenarios, though it maintained similar evaluation methodologies. Both benchmarks, however, evaluate LLMs as isolated code generation systems without considering their communicative capabilities.

\textbf{CodeXGLUE} \cite{lu2021codexglue} and \textbf{APPS} \cite{hendrycks2021measuring} introduced more complex evaluation scenarios, but continued to focus on generation accuracy rather than interactive problem-solving capabilities.

\subsection{Communication and Collaboration in AI Systems}

Recent work has begun exploring AI communication capabilities beyond simple question-answering:

\textbf{Interactive Task Learning} \cite{wang2021towards} demonstrated that AI systems can learn more effectively through targeted questioning, though this work focused on toy domains rather than complex programming tasks.

\textbf{Conversational AI Evaluation} \cite{adiwardana2020towards} established frameworks for assessing dialogue quality, but these metrics are not directly applicable to technical problem-solving contexts.

\textbf{Meta-Learning Approaches} \cite{finn2017model} have shown that AI systems can improve through self-reflection and correction, providing inspiration for the multi-model evaluation paradigm.

\subsection{Trustworthiness in Code Generation}

As AI systems become more integrated into software development, trustworthiness concerns have gained prominence:

\textbf{Security Analysis} \cite{pearce2022asleep} revealed that LLM-generated code often contains vulnerabilities, necessitating systematic security evaluation.

\textbf{Reliability Assessment} \cite{chen2021evaluating} demonstrated that LLM outputs can be inconsistent across similar inputs, highlighting the need for robustness testing.

\textbf{Efficiency Considerations} \cite{nijkamp2022codegen} showed that AI-generated code may not always prioritize computational efficiency, suggesting the need for multi-dimensional quality assessment.

\subsection{HumanEvalComm and Communication Competence}

The previous work \cite{wu2025humanevalcomm} introduced the concept of communication competence in code generation, establishing that LLMs vary significantly in their ability to recognize and address problematic problem specifications. This work laid the foundation for HumanEvalComm V2 by demonstrating the importance of communication in AI-assisted programming.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{../architecture.png}
    \caption{HumanEvalComm V2 Framework Architecture Overview}
    \label{fig:architecture-overview}
\end{figure}

HumanEvalComm V2 builds upon the foundation established by the original HumanEvalComm while introducing significant methodological enhancements. This section describes the expanded evaluation framework, enhanced metrics, and multi-model assessment approach.

\subsection{Problem Set and Modifications}

We maintain the core problem set from HumanEvalComm, consisting of 762 modified problem descriptions derived from the original 164 HumanEval problems. Each modification introduces one or more clarification challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ambiguity (1a)}: 164 problems with intentionally ambiguous specifications
    \item \textbf{Inconsistency (1c)}: 164 problems with contradictory requirements
    \item \textbf{Incompleteness (1p)}: 164 problems with missing critical information
    \item \textbf{Combined Challenges (2ac, 2cp, 2ap)}: 270 problems combining multiple clarification types
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Model Evaluation Framework}

A key innovation of HumanEvalComm V2 is the multi-model evaluation paradigm, where LLMs serve dual roles as both generators and evaluators. This approach enables:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cross-Model Assessment}: Different models evaluate each other's outputs, providing diverse perspectives on code quality and communication effectiveness.
    \item \textbf{Meta-Evaluation Capabilities}: Models can assess not just code correctness, but also the quality of communication and problem comprehension.
    \item \textbf{Robustness Testing}: Evaluation across multiple judge models reduces individual model biases and provides more reliable assessments.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Enhanced Communication Metrics}

Beyond the binary question-asking assessment of the original framework, HumanEvalComm V2 introduces multi-dimensional communication evaluation that captures the nuanced aspects of clarification-seeking behavior. The enhanced metrics assess not only whether models ask questions, but also the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of their communication strategies.

\subsubsection{Communication Rate (Comm Rate)}

The Communication Rate represents the proportion of problems where the model demonstrates recognition of clarification needs and initiates appropriate questioning behavior. This metric is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathit{CommRate} = \frac{N_{q}}{N_{p}}
\end{equation}

A response is considered clarification-seeking if it contains explicit questions about problem requirements, constraints, or specifications that indicate the model has identified potential ambiguities or gaps in the provided information. This metric captures the model's baseline sensitivity to problematic problem formulations, serving as a fundamental indicator of communication awareness.

\subsubsection{Question Quality (Good Q Rate)}

The Question Quality Rate evaluates the relevance, specificity, and potential effectiveness of clarification questions posed by the model. This metric goes beyond mere question-asking to assess the communicative competence of the queries themselves.

Quality assessment considers multiple dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Relevance}: Does the question address actual ambiguities in the problem statement?
    \item \textbf{Specificity}: Is the question focused enough to elicit actionable clarification?
    \item \textbf{Constructiveness}: Would the expected answer help resolve the identified issue?
    \item \textbf{Appropriateness}: Is the question framed in a professional, technical manner?
\end{itemize}

Each question is evaluated by multiple judge models on a 5-point Likert scale, with scores aggregated using inter-rater reliability measures to ensure consistency.

\subsubsection{Communication Effectiveness}

Communication Effectiveness measures the degree to which clarification-seeking behavior correlates with improved problem comprehension and subsequent code generation quality. This metric establishes a causal link between communicative actions and technical outcomes.

Effectiveness is assessed through a multi-stage evaluation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clarification Impact}: Analysis of how clarification questions align with actual problem ambiguities
    \item \textbf{Resolution Quality}: Assessment of whether follow-up responses (when clarifications are provided) lead to better code
    \item \textbf{Iterative Improvement}: Measurement of communication strategies across multiple interaction rounds
    \item \textbf{Outcome Correlation}: Statistical analysis relating communication patterns to final code quality metrics
\end{enumerate}

This metric provides insights into whether models engage in productive dialogue versus merely asking questions for appearance.

\subsection{Comprehensive Code Quality Assessment}

HumanEvalComm V2 integrates multiple evaluation dimensions to provide holistic assessment of generated code:

\subsubsection{Functional Correctness}

Traditional pass@k metrics measuring whether generated code passes the required test cases.

\subsubsection{Static Analysis}

Automated assessment of code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices using tools like pylint and flake8.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Testing}

Runtime behavior analysis including performance profiling and edge case testing.

\subsubsection{Security Assessment}

Vulnerability scanning and security analysis of generated code.

\subsubsection{Efficiency Evaluation}

Computational complexity analysis and resource usage assessment.

\subsection{V2 Composite Scoring System}

To provide a unified assessment framework, we introduce the V2 Score, a composite metric that balances multiple evaluation dimensions:

\begin{align}
    \mathit{V2Score} =
    &\; w_1 \cdot \mathit{Communication}
    + w_2 \cdot \mathit{Correctness} \\
    &\; + w_3 \cdot \mathit{Trustworthiness}
\end{align}

Where the component scores are calculated as:

\textbf{Communication Component:}
\begin{align}
    \mathit{Communication} =
    &\; \alpha \cdot \mathit{CommRate}
    + \beta \cdot \mathit{GoodQRate} \\
    &\; + \gamma \cdot \mathit{Effectiveness}
\end{align}

\textbf{Correctness Component:}
\begin{align}
    \mathit{Correctness} =
    &\; \delta \cdot \mathit{Pass@1}
    + \epsilon \cdot \mathit{TestRate} \\
    &\; + \zeta \cdot \mathit{Readability}
\end{align}

\textbf{Trustworthiness Component:}
\begin{align}
    \mathit{Trustworthiness} =
    &\; \eta \cdot \mathit{Security}
    + \theta \cdot \mathit{Reliability} \\
    &\; + \iota \cdot \mathit{Efficiency}
\end{align}

The weights ($w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$) are calibrated based on empirical analysis of developer preferences and code quality priorities, with component sub-weights ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, etc.) determined through factor analysis of benchmark performance data. This hierarchical scoring system ensures that the V2 Score reflects both high-level evaluation dimensions and their constituent metrics.

\subsection{Evaluation Pipeline}

The comprehensive evaluation pipeline consists of four integrated stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Generation Phase}: Models generate code responses to modified problems
    \item \textbf{Communication Assessment}: Multi-model evaluation of clarification-seeking behavior
    \item \textbf{Code Quality Analysis}: Automated testing and static analysis
    \item \textbf{Trustworthiness Evaluation}: Security, reliability, and efficiency assessment
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Developer Tools and Interactive Leaderboard}

While academic benchmarks like HumanEvalComm V2 provide rigorous evaluation methodologies, a critical gap often exists between research insights and practical developer adoption. To bridge this gap and transform theoretical evaluation results into actionable developer intelligence, we implemented a comprehensive web-based leaderboard platform that serves as the primary interface between the benchmark framework and real-world software development workflows.

\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs across the complete HumanEvalComm V2 benchmark, consisting of 163 modified programming problems derived from the original HumanEval dataset. This represents a significant scale-up from previous evaluations, providing robust statistical insights into model performance patterns.

\textbf{Evaluated Models:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPT-4o-mini}: A compact yet capable model optimized for efficiency and cost-effectiveness
    \item \textbf{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct}: An open-source model with strong general capabilities
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek-Chat}: A competitive open-source model with advanced reasoning capabilities
    \item \textbf{Claude-3-Haiku}: Anthropic's efficient model designed for fast, high-quality responses
    \item \textbf{Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B}: A specialized code generation model with large parameter count
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation Configuration:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem Set}: 163 modified problems (762 total evaluations across all models)
    \item \textbf{Temperature}: 0.1 (for consistency and reproducibility)
    \item \textbf{Max Tokens}: 2048 (sufficient for complete code solutions and clarifications)
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Metrics}: Multi-dimensional assessment including communication competence, functional correctness, code quality, and trustworthiness
    \item \textbf{Statistical Validation}: Cross-model evaluation with inter-rater reliability measures
\end{itemize}

The evaluation was conducted using our production-ready HumanEvalComm V2 framework, which implements the comprehensive evaluation pipeline described in Section III. All experiments were run with identical configurations to ensure fair comparison across models.

\subsection{Communication Competence Results}

Our analysis reveals significant variation in communication competence across the evaluated models, with clear patterns emerging in how different architectures approach clarification-seeking behavior.

\subsubsection{Overall Communication Performance}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Communication Competence Results Across Models}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Comm Rate} & \textbf{Good Q Rate} & \textbf{Communication Pattern} \\
\midrule
GPT-4o-mini & 33\% & 74\% & Very Confident \\
Llama-3.1-8B & 40\% & 74\% & Balanced \\
DeepSeek-Chat & 50\% & 75\% & Balanced \\
Claude-3-Haiku & 63\% & 76\% & Cautious \\
Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B & 58\% & 74\% & Cautious \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:communication_results}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate a 30 percentage point range in communication rates, from GPT-4o-mini's confident 33\% to Claude-3-Haiku's cautious 63\%. This variation reflects fundamental differences in model training objectives and architectural approaches to uncertainty handling.

\subsubsection{Communication vs. Performance Trade-offs}

Interestingly, we observed a strong negative correlation between communication frequency and overall performance. Models that ask more questions tend to achieve lower composite scores, suggesting a trade-off between thoroughness and efficiency.

\begin{align}
\rho(\text{Comm Rate}, \text{V2 Score}) = -0.88
\end{align}

This correlation can be quantified as:

\begin{align}
\Delta \text{V2 Score per 10\% Comm Rate} = -0.29
\end{align}

\subsection{Code Quality and Functional Correctness}

\subsubsection{Execution Performance}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Functional Correctness and Test Performance}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Pass@1} & \textbf{Test Pass Rate} & \textbf{Execution Rank} & \textbf{Test Rank} \\
\midrule
GPT-4o-mini & 86\% & 65\% & 1st & 1st \\
DeepSeek-Chat & 78\% & 50\% & 2nd & 2nd \\
Llama-3.1-8B & 76\% & 55\% & 3rd & 3rd \\
Claude-3-Haiku & 77\% & 45\% & 4th & 4th \\
Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B & 69\% & 38\% & 5th & 5th \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:functional_correctness}
\end{table}

GPT-4o-mini demonstrates superior execution performance with an 86\% Pass@1 rate, representing a 17 percentage point advantage over the lowest performer. However, test pass rates reveal more nuanced performance differences, with GPT-4o-mini maintaining a 15 percentage point lead in comprehensive testing.

\subsubsection{Code Quality Metrics}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Code Quality and Trustworthiness Metrics}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Readability} & \textbf{Security} & \textbf{Efficiency} & \textbf{Reliability} & \textbf{Quality Rank} \\
\midrule
GPT-4o-mini & 75 & 71 & 0.86 & 0.76 & 1st \\
Llama-3.1-8B & 63 & 59 & 0.76 & 0.67 & 2nd \\
DeepSeek-Chat & 62 & 58 & 0.78 & 0.68 & 3rd \\
Claude-3-Haiku & 59 & 55 & 0.77 & 0.67 & 4th \\
Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B & 52 & 48 & 0.69 & 0.60 & 5th \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:code_quality}
\end{table}

Code quality metrics reveal substantial variation across models, with readability scores ranging from 52 to 75 (23-point spread) and security scores from 48 to 71 (23-point spread). These differences significantly impact the final composite scores.

\subsection{V2 Composite Score Analysis}

\subsubsection{Overall Performance Rankings}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{V2 Composite Score Rankings and Performance Gaps}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{V2 Score} & \textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Gap to Leader} & \textbf{Performance Category} \\
\midrule
GPT-4o-mini & 6.9 & 1st & -- & Superior \\
Llama-3.1-8B & 5.8 & 2nd & -1.1 & Strong \\
DeepSeek-Chat & 5.6 & 3rd & -1.3 & Good \\
Claude-3-Haiku & 5.2 & 4th & -1.7 & Moderate \\
Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B & 4.6 & 5th & -2.3 & Developing \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:v2_scores}
\end{table}

The V2 composite scoring system reveals clear performance differentiation, with GPT-4o-mini achieving the highest score of 6.9 and a 2.3-point gap to the lowest performer. This comprehensive evaluation framework successfully captures the multi-dimensional nature of code generation competence.

\subsubsection{Performance Correlations}

Statistical analysis reveals strong correlations between different performance dimensions:

\begin{align}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Findings}

HumanEvalComm V2 provides comprehensive insights into the capabilities and limitations of modern LLMs in code generation tasks, revealing several important patterns and trade-offs.

\subsubsection{Communication-Performance Trade-off}

Our large-scale evaluation across 163 problems reveals a fundamental trade-off between communication frequency and overall performance. Models that ask more questions tend to achieve lower composite scores, with a strong negative correlation ($\rho = -0.88$) between communication rate and V2 score.

This finding suggests that while communication competence is valuable, excessive questioning may indicate underlying uncertainty or architectural limitations that impact code generation quality. The optimal balance appears to be moderate communication rates (40-50\%), as exemplified by Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-Chat.

\subsubsection{Code Quality as Dominant Factor}

The analysis demonstrates that code quality metrics (readability and security) are the strongest predictors of overall performance, with correlations of 0.99 with final V2 scores. This finding has important implications for AI-assisted development:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Readability Impact}: A 1-point increase in readability score correlates with a 0.43 increase in V2 score
    \item \textbf{Security Impact}: A 1-point increase in security score correlates with a 0.42 increase in V2 score
    \item \textbf{Combined Effect}: Quality metrics account for approximately 60\% of the variance in final rankings
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Architecture Insights}

Different model architectures exhibit distinct behavioral patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Efficient Models (GPT-4o-mini)}: Demonstrate high confidence with low communication rates (33\%) but superior execution performance (86\% Pass@1)
    \item \textbf{Balanced Models (Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-Chat)}: Moderate communication rates (40-50\%) with solid overall performance
    \item \textbf{Cautious Models (Claude-3-Haiku, Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B)}: High communication rates (58-63\%) but lower execution success rates
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Trustworthiness Implications}

The evaluation reveals that communication competence serves as a proxy for overall system reliability. Models with higher communication rates tend to have lower trustworthiness scores, suggesting that frequent questioning may indicate fundamental limitations in problem comprehension or solution generation capabilities.

\subsection{Implications for AI-Assisted Development}

    \item \textbf{Educational Contexts}: Cautious models like Claude-3-Haiku may be preferable for learning environments where thorough questioning is beneficial
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Training and Fine-Tuning}

The performance patterns suggest several directions for improving AI coding assistants:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Confidence Calibration}: Training objectives that better balance confidence with accuracy
    \item \textbf{Communication Training}: Fine-tuning datasets that teach appropriate levels of clarification-seeking
    \item \textbf{Quality Optimization}: Enhanced focus on code readability and security in training objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Human-AI Collaboration Models}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

HumanEvalComm V2 establishes a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM communication competence in code generation tasks. Through our large-scale evaluation of five state-of-the-art models across 163 problems, we provide empirical evidence of fundamental trade-offs between communication frequency and overall performance, with code quality emerging as the dominant factor in determining model rankings.

The framework introduces several methodological innovations: (1) multi-model evaluation paradigms that enable cross-validation and bias detection, (2) comprehensive trustworthiness assessment integrating security, reliability, and efficiency metrics, and (3) a V2 composite scoring system that successfully differentiates model capabilities across a 2.3-point performance range.

Our empirical findings reveal that while communication competence is valuable, excessive questioning correlates negatively with performance ($\rho = -0.88$), suggesting that the most effective AI coding assistants balance confidence with appropriate clarification-seeking. Code quality metrics demonstrate the strongest predictive power ($\rho = 0.99$ with final scores), indicating that readability and security should be prioritized in AI development efforts.

The interactive leaderboard platform bridges the gap between academic research and practical application, providing developers with transparent, evidence-based guidance for AI tool selection. This implementation represents a significant advancement in making sophisticated evaluation frameworks accessible to practitioners.

HumanEvalComm V2's extensible design ensures its continued relevance as AI models evolve, providing the research community with robust tools for understanding and improving communication competence in AI-assisted software development. The framework's comprehensive approach—combining communication assessment, functional correctness, code quality, and trustworthiness evaluation—establishes a new standard for holistic AI evaluation in programming contexts.
